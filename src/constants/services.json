The Earth is always at Zero potential and is always willing to absorb any quantum of current impressed on it by nature (like Lightning bolts) or by manmade means like a live Electric conductor touching the ground. Through earthing, a conductive path is provided to absorb all electrical potential that either accidentally comes in contact with the mechanical frame of power equipment/housing or is intentionally connected to establish a zero-reference level in case of power generation/distribution. A lightning protection system diverts all incoming lightning strokes into the ground. The Terminators have designed and implemented several lightning protection systems and made several hundred earthing stations INCLUDING copper plate, rod, pipe, and Chemical Electrodes Earthing. Most of the world renowned brands like Furse, DEHN, Erico, Cooper etc. have been dealt with.",
